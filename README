Hi there 👋

I’m Ramses (he/him), a Cybersecurity student and junior DFIR-oriented practitioner preparing for a career in Digital Forensics & Incident Response, with a long-term goal of working in Zurich, Switzerland 🇨🇭.
My focus is on incident analysis, artifact collection, Linux/Windows systems, and networking, with all work clearly documented and reproducible.
